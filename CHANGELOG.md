## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-03

### Added
- Initial implementation of Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem
- Initial implementation of OSS (Ong-Schnorr-Shamir) digital signature scheme
- Complete signcryption system using Sign-then-Encrypt architecture
- Modular Python implementation with clean separation of concerns
- Comprehensive unit tests for all cryptographic components
- Integration tests for complete signcryption workflow
- GUI application with user-friendly interface and clear feedback
- Key generation and management functionality
- File-based operations for keys and messages
- Educational examples demonstrating usage and vulnerabilities
- Extensive documentation and security warnings
- Professional analysis memo integration
- HCI-compliant user interface design
- Error handling and input validation
- Support for large message encryption via chunking
- Unicode message support
- Comprehensive security warnings throughout

### Security Notes
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: OSS signature scheme is cryptographically broken
- ⚠️ Vulnerable to signature forgery attacks
- ⚠️ Educational use only - NOT for production
- Includes demonstration of OSS vulnerability for educational purposes
- All modules include appropriate security warnings

### Technical Features
- Python 3.8+ compatibility
- Tkinter-based GUI with modern design principles
- JSON-based key storage format
- Base64 encoding for encrypted data
- PKCS#7-style padding for messages
- Probabilistic encryption (different ciphertexts for same plaintext)
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- PEP 8 compliant code style
- Extensive docstring documentation
- Modular architecture following software engineering best practices

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Security policy documenting known vulnerabilities
- Professional analysis memo explaining design decisions
- Basic usage examples with educational content
- API documentation via docstrings
- Makefile for common development tasks
- Setup.py for package distribution

### Testing
- Unit tests for Schmidt-Samoa cryptosystem
- Unit tests for OSS signature scheme
- Integration tests for complete signcryption workflow
- Tests for tampering detection
- Tests for key compatibility
- Tests for large message handling
- Tests for Unicode support
- Tests demonstrating OSS vulnerability
- Pytest configuration and coverage reporting

### Dependencies
- PyCryptodome >= 3.18.0 (cryptographic primitives)
- cryptography >= 41.0.0 (additional crypto support)
- sympy >= 1.12 (mathematical operations)
- tkinter (GUI framework, usually included with Python)
- pytest >= 7.4.0 (testing framework)

### Known Limitations
- OSS signature scheme is cryptographically insecure by design
- Not suitable for any production use
- Limited to educational and demonstration purposes
- Schmidt-Samoa implementation uses simplified approach
- No formal security validation or certification

### Future Educational Enhancements (Potential)
- Comparison with secure alternatives (RSA, ECDSA)
- Additional cryptanalysis demonstrations
- Performance benchmarking
- Visual cryptographic demonstrations
- Integration with educational cryptography curriculum
