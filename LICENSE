IMPORTANT SECURITY DISCLAIMER:

This software implements the Ong-Schnorr-Shamir (OSS) digital signature scheme,
which is CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY BROKEN and vulnerable to signature forgery attacks.
This implementation is provided for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY SECURITY-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.

For production use, employ industry-standard cryptographic algorithms such as:
- RSA with appropriate padding (PKCS#1 v2.0/OAEP)
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- ECDSA or EdDSA for digital signatures
- AES for symmetric encryption

The authors and contributors disclaim any responsibility for security
vulnerabilities, data breaches, or other damages that may result from
improper use of this educational software.
